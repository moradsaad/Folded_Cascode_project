WARNING (ADE-6001): The number of terminals specified in CDF termOrder are more
           than the actual number of terminals in the cellview cell-view "folded_cascode_project" "opamp_sympol" "schematic"
WARNING (ADE-6004): Mismatch was found between the terminals in the cellView and those on the
           termOrder property on the CDF. Because of the mismatch, the CDF termOrder will
           be ignored. The terminals in the cellView will be netlisted in the alphabetical
           order of their names. Eliminate the mismatch if you want the CDF termOrder
           property to be used for netlisting.
           To edit CDF of a cell, 
           i) Open CIW->Tools->CDF->Edit.
           ii) Select Library Name & Cell Name.
           iii) Click on the Edit button in the simulation information section of the
                Edit CDF window.

Simulation design variables differ from those on the cellView,
they have been saved in the file "/tmp/saved-design-variables".
