To view the simulator output, right-click on the test name, result 
name, or any value in the "Results" tab of the Outputs section and 
choose "Output Log" menu option.
INFO (ADE-3072): Simulation is stopped by user. Simulation results may not be complete.
ERROR (ADE-3036): Errors encountered during simulation. The simulator run log has not been generated.
        Possible cause could be an invalid command line option for the version of the simulator
        you are running. Choose Setup->Environment and verify that the command line options
        specified in the userCmdLineOption field are supported for the simulator.
        Alternatively, run the simulator standalone using the runSimulation file in the netlist
        directory to know the exact cause of the error.

*Error*   Error ID  = 5011
*Error*   Error Msg = Simulator failed to complete the simulation.

          The simulator process returned a non-zero exit code -1,
          indicating failure.
The simulator could have crashed or
          intentionally returned to indicate an error.
Check the
          simulator log file for more information.  Common causes:
1.
          Simulator may have crashed during exit even after reporting
          success in log file.
2. Abrupt automatic simulator
          termination (e.g., SIGKILL) because the simulator process
          has
   exceeded resource limits, which can be specified in
          the distribution system or
   by the kernel itself (e.g.,
          the Linux OOMKiller).
3. Manual termination of the
          simulator process.
./runSimulation can be manually run in
          this directory to check the issue.




Simulation design variables differ from those on the cellView,
they have been saved in the file "/tmp/saved-design-variables".
To save future changes, copy variables to cellView before exiting.
